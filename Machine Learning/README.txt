Setup:

1) get emails data by launching /tools/startup.py (it's about 500MB)
2) all other folders contains ML scripts analyzing on that set with different algorithms, 
	ready to launch with visualization; launch each of them annd behold.
	
Misc:
	-2to3.py was used to check compatibility of some auxiliary scripts written in Python2
	Now all the scripts whould be Python3
	
	-can uncomment different configurations in ML scripts for different results
	
	-'emails_by_address' folder not included into 'final_project', 
	but it's identical to 'maildir' created in project root during a setup
